                    <h2>Built and then recognized</h2>
                    <p>It's just a game, but it's memorable—that's the perfect way to describe it. I used to play on the LunarPride Community and Jogjagamer Reality Project servers, but I got bored with that, so I tried out Valiant Roleplay in my community at the time. I just signed up out of curiosity, with no real plans in mind. However, since I knew I had an opportunity here, I applied to become one of the staff members of Valiant Roleplay, and at that time I was in charge of the LSFD and LSGMC factions, which were very challenging but also very rewarding.\n \n My friends trusted me at that time and Walley assigned me to be the General Administrator, a high-ranking position with a lot of responsibility. At that time, I was impressed by the new way of working pioneered by the new members. I admit that I was not as good as them, but I was there, and I was not to be underestimated. I thought, if not now, then when? Should I quit? I didn't have much time left.</p>
